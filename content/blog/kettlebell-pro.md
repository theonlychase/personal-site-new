## Kettlebell Pro

I'll keep this short for now. It's been fun putting this together. Still a work in progress. Currently working on recording the videos for each exercise. 

Check it out at [kettlebellpro.fit](https://kettlebellpro.fit){:target="_blank"}. Subscribe for updates!

### Tech Stack

Built with Nuxt 4, Vue 3, Typescript, Nuxt Content, Nuxt UI Pro alongside Tailwind 4, PostGres, and a few other cool things.
