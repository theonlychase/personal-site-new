## Natashas Cakery

My wife has been selling cakes for neighbors around the neighborhood. Demand has been high and she needs a way to showcase her cakes and take orders.

I put together a one page site for her to use. As her small business grows, I'll continue to add more features. 

We used Sora to whip up a logo (we aren't sure if this will stick yet), and added her domain that we've had for awhile, but we haven't used until now.

I added Motion animations to a few elements for animating in and out based on scroll position. Pretty sweet library. 

Check it out at [natashaisley.com](https://natashaisley.com/){:target="_blank"}.

### Tech Stack

Nuxt 4, Vue 3, Typescript, Nuxt UI 4, Tailwind 4, Motion, Mailgun for sending orders.
